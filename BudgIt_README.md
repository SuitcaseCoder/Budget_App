## Summary
This is BudgIt, a visual, event-based budgeting app to help users better budget for upcoming events.

## Details
The user will be greeted with an introduction section. This section will help guide the user in using BudgIt.The user will also find an 'add Event' button, which will allow them to **add as many new events** as they wish. As events are added, the user has two options with each event. An **event may either be selected**, taking the user to its expenses page *or* the user may choose to **delete that event**, resulting in that event being deleted from the list (and database). Once an event has been selected, the user will have the option to **add expenses**. Once an event has one or more expenses, the user will have the opportunity to *adjust the amounts of money* they wish to spend on each of the expenses. The user will also **be immediately warned if they happen to go past their desired budget for their upcoming event**.

## Technology
*BudgIt* was built using JavaScript on the client-side, along with Node.js for the server-side. The database is hosted using Mongo's Atlas service and the app itself is running on Heroku.
